Linux Kernel
============

Please read: /Documentation/process/changes.rst 
contains requirements for building and running the Kernel,
and information about the problems may result by upgrading the kernel.

Run ./Documentation/process/check_version.sh 
to verify requirements.
make executable: `chmod +x ./check_version.sh` then `./check_version.sh`


There are several guides for Kernel developers and users. 
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
